SshMySQL
========

C# ssh program that will remotely run queries on a MySQL database. This program uses the mysql .Net connector (http://www.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/) and the Renci.SshNet library (http://sshnet.codeplex.com/)
Please update all your server and mysql information in the code. 
I have filled in bonus information in the program for clarity.
